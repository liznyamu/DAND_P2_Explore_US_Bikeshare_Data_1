# Udacity DAND P2 : Explore US Bikeshare Data

Use Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data. Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

# Project Overview

## Overview 
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
