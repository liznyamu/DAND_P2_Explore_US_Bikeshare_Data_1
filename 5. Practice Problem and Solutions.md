# Practice Problem and Solutions

These three practice problems in the following few sections will help you prepare for the project. These problems use the same mini version of the actual chicago.csv dataset that you will use for the project.



## Practice Problem #1: Compute the Most Popular Start Hour
Use pandas to load chicago.csv into a dataframe, and find the most frequent hour when people start traveling. There isn't an hour column in this dataset, but you can create one by extracting the hour from the "Start Time" column. To do this, you can convert "Start Time" to the datetime datatype using the pandas [to_datetime()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.to_datetime.html) method and extracting properties such as the hour with [these properties](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#datetimelike-properties).

Hint: Another way to describe the most common value in a column is the mode.


## Practice Solution #1: Compute the Most Popular Start Hour

```python

import pandas as pd

filename = 'chicago.csv'

# load data file into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

# convert the Start Time column to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'])

# extract hour from the Start Time column to create an hour column
df['hour'] = df['Start Time'].dt.hour

# find the most popular hour
popular_hour = df['hour'].mode()[0]

print('Most Popular Start Hour:', popular_hour)

```

### Outputs:
```python

Most Popular Start Hour: 17

```


## Practice Problem #2: Display a Breakdown of User Types

There are different types of users specified in the "User Type" column. Find how many there are of each type and store the counts in a pandas Series in the user_types variable.

Hint: What pandas function returns a Series with the counts of each unique value in a column?


## Practice Solution #2: Display a Breakdown of User Types

```python

import pandas as pd

filename = 'chicago.csv'

# load data file into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

# print value counts for each user type
user_types = df['User Type'].value_counts()

print(user_types)

```

### Outputs:
```python

Subscriber    330
Customer       70
Name: User Type, dtype: int64

```

## Practice Problem #3: Load and Filter the Dataset

This is a bit of a bigger task, which involves choosing a dataset to load and filtering it based on a specified month and day. In the quiz below, you'll implement the *load_data()* function, which you can use directly in your project. There are four steps:

1. **Load the dataset for the specified city**. Index the global *CITY_DATA* dictionary object to get the corresponding filename for the given city name.

2. **Create *month* and *day_of_week* columns.** Convert the "Start Time" column to datetime and extract the month number and weekday name into separate columns using the *datetime* module.

3. **Filter by month.** Since the *month* parameter is given as the name of the month, you'll need to first convert this to the corresponding month number. Then, select rows of the dataframe that have the specified month and reassign this as the new dataframe.

4. **Filter by day of week.** Select rows of the dataframe that have the specified day of week and reassign this as the new dataframe. (Note: Capitalize the *day* parameter with the *title()* method to match the title case used in the *day_of_week column!)*


## Practice Solution #3: Loading and Filtering Data

```python

import pandas as pd

CITY_DATA = { 'chicago': 'chicago.csv',
              'new york city': 'new_york_city.csv',
              'washington': 'washington.csv' }

def load_data(city, month, day):
    """
    Loads data for the specified city and filters by month and day if applicable.

    Args:
        (str) city - name of the city to analyze
        (str) month - name of the month to filter by, or "all" to apply no month filter
        (str) day - name of the day of week to filter by, or "all" to apply no day filter
    Returns:
        df - Pandas DataFrame containing city data filtered by month and day
    """

    # load data file into a dataframe
    df = pd.read_csv(CITY_DATA[city])

    # convert the Start Time column to datetime
    df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'])

    # extract month and day of week from Start Time to create new columns
    df['month'] = df['Start Time'].dt.month
    df['day_of_week'] = df['Start Time'].dt.weekday_name

    # filter by month if applicable
    if month != 'all':
        # use the index of the months list to get the corresponding int
        months = ['january', 'february', 'march', 'april', 'may', 'june']
        month = months.index(month) + 1

        # filter by month to create the new dataframe
        df = df[df['month'] == month]

    # filter by day of week if applicable
    if day != 'all':
        # filter by day of week to create the new dataframe
        df = df[df['day_of_week'] == day.title()]

    return df

```
