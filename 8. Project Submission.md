# Project Submission
In this project, you will write Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


## Before You Submit
### Check the Rubric
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1379/view). Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it is up to expectations. In particular, there is one section of the rubric that focuses on the quality of your code. It is important that you not only obtain the correct answers with your code, but that you have followed good coding practices to obtain your solutions.


## Gather Submission Materials
All you need to submit for this project is two files:

- **bikeshare.py**: Your code
- **readme.txt**: If you refer to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them in this file

There is no need for you to include any data files with your submission.


## Submitting the Project
When you're ready, click on the "Submit Project" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at the time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each of your projects in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.
